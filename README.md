# Graphical-login
An android app is designed such that it will overcome some of the security attacks.

All Authentication systems are based on username and passwords. Alphanumeric passwords are prone to many dictionary and guess attacks. Mostly all alphanumeric passwords without any special characters can be broken easily.
In order to overcome the above problems graphical passwords are used. The graphical passwords are easy to remember but these are also prone to many attacks like shoulder surfing and hidden camera attacks etc., So we proposed a system that provides user a virtual keyboard and resist the above-mentioned attacks. The proposed system is suitable only for android phones.
